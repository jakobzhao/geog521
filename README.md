# GEOG521 Research Seminar: Critical GIS

This research seminar explores the evolving field of Critical GIS, a subfield of Geographic Information Science (GIScience) that critically examines the social, political, and epistemological dimensions of geospatial technologies. The course engages with theoretical debates, methodological innovations, and practical applications at the intersection of GIS, critical geography, and digital spatial analysis.

Students will be introduced to key critiques of GIS, including discussions on power, representation, surveillance, and digital inequalities. We will explore how GIS has been used both as a tool of control and as an instrument for social justice and empowerment, engaging with topics such as participatory mapping, counter-cartography, and GeoNarratives.

This seminar also provides hands-on exposure to emerging geospatial technologies such as GeoAI (Geospatial Artificial Intelligence), machine learning for spatial analysis, and geospatial storytelling. Students will learn to apply mixed-methods research, integrating qualitative and quantitative approaches to spatial data analysis.

By the end of the course, students will have developed both critical thinking skills and technical competencies, enabling them to engage with GIS not just as a set of analytical tools, but as a dynamic and contested space of knowledge production. This course is designed for graduate students and advanced undergraduates interested in GIS, digital geography, spatial data science, and interdisciplinary approaches to spatial analysis.

## Course Objectives
By the end of this course, students will:

-Develop a foundational understanding of Critical GIS, including its critiques and applications.
-Examine the relationship between GIS, power, and society, engaging with debates on spatial data politics, surveillance, and digital inequalities.
-Gain hands-on experience with GeoAI, participatory mapping, and geovisualization techniques.
-Apply mixed-methods research, integrating quantitative GIS analysis with qualitative spatial narratives.
-Critically assess how GIS is used in different domains, from urban planning and environmental justice to digital activism and spatial humanities.
-Design and execute an independent research project, which may take the form of either a GIS-based project or a critical research essay.

## Course Topics

The course is structured around key themes in Critical GIS, with weekly topics including:

1. Introduction to Critical GIS

What is Critical GIS?
Key debates: positivism vs. poststructuralism, power and representation in GIS

2. Data, Power, and Ethics in GIS

Spatial data infrastructures and the politics of mapping
Ethical considerations in location tracking and surveillance capitalism

3. Mixed-Methods Research in GIS

Combining qualitative and quantitative spatial analysis
Case studies in participatory GIS and community mapping

4. GeoAI and the Future of Spatial Analysis

The role of machine learning in geospatial research
Deepfake geography and algorithmic bias in spatial data

5. GeoNarratives and Critical Cartography

Counter-mapping and narrative GIS
Story maps as tools for social change

6. Participatory GIS and Citizen Science

Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) and open-source mapping
Ethics of participatory mapping and community engagement

7. Geovisualization and Critical Spatial Analysis

Mapping uncertainty and ambiguity
The role of aesthetics in cartography and geospatial representation

8. Final Project Development and Presentations

Student presentations of research projects and peer feedback

## Course Format & Assignments
This seminar will be discussion-driven and hands-on, combining weekly readings, lab exercises, and independent research projects.

- Weekly Readings & Reflections (20%)
Students will engage with key readings and submit critical reflections before class discussions.

- GIS Lab Exercises (20%)
Hands-on exercises will introduce students to GeoAI, participatory mapping, and spatial storytelling platforms.

- Seminar Leadership & Discussion (20%)
Each student will lead a seminar discussion, facilitating engagement with course materials.

- Final Research Project (40%)
Students will complete an independent research project, which may take one of the following forms:

  - A GIS-based project: A spatial analysis or mapping project that critically applies the methods learned in class.
  - A research essay: A theoretical or methodological paper engaging with Critical GIS concepts.

The final deliverable will include a written report and a presentation.

## Course Policies
Attendance & Participation: Active participation in seminar discussions and lab sessions is expected.
Academic Integrity: All work must adhere to university policies on plagiarism and academic honesty.
Accommodations: Students requiring accommodations should contact Disability Resources for Students (DRS).
Technology Use: Students are encouraged to use QGIS, Python, or R for geospatial analysis.

## Final Notes
This course welcomes students from diverse backgrounds and disciplines, including geography, data science, urban planning, china studies, environmental studies, and digital humanities. While some familiarity with GIS is helpful, no prior technical experience is required, and support will be provided for students new to GIS tools.
