<img src="res/cover-2023-2.png" align="right" tooltip="The cover image was made using a generative phrase 'a digital earth that is also a human brain.' by MidJourney on April 3, 2023." width="35%" target="_blank" />  This research seminar explores Critical GIS, a field that interrogates the social, political, and epistemological dimensions of geospatial technologies. Through theoretical debates and hands-on projects, students will examine how GIS functions both as a tool of control and as a medium for resistance, empowerment, and social justice. Topics include participatory mapping, counter-cartography, surveillance, digital inequality, and the politics of spatial data. The course also introduces emerging tools such as GeoAI, machine learning for spatial analysis, and geospatial storytelling.

Students will engage in mixed-methods research, integrating qualitative and quantitative approaches to critically assess how GIS is used across domains such as urban planning, environmental justice, digital activism, and spatial humanities. By the end of the seminar, students will gain both critical perspectives and technical skills, understanding GIS not just as software, but as a contested space of knowledge production.

Open to graduate students and advanced undergraduates from diverse disciplines—including geography, data science, urban planning, China studies, environmental studies, and digital humanities. No prior technical experience is required; support will be provided throughout the course.

### Week 4: CyberGIS

The emergence of CyberGIS in early 2010 represents an important research direction in GIS that incorporates an evolving group of web technologies (e.g., cloud service, world wide web, etc.) to advance the capacity of GIS itself in dealing with complex geographical questions. In the same period, other topics like Cloud GIS *(Yang 2011)*, Spatial Infrastructures *(Wright 2011)* also appeared. This research direction has enabled GIS to deploy in a more distributed structure but not necessarily being located in a centralized place. In this way, GIS can utilize more computational resources over the Internet or the Cloud and process more complex and large-scale geographical algorithms. In this week, we will get us familiar with the concept of CyberGIS by reading Shaowen Wang's paper on "CyberGIS Framework," and then read another paper on Blockchain from *Bo Zhao and his co-author (2020)*. Blockchain is a representative technology for Web 3.0 - a new phase of web technologies. With a general background of the research direction around CyberGIS, its relevance to Web 3.0, we will build a better understanding of why this wave of cyberGIS appears in early 2010, its connection to the development of ICT (Information and communications technology) and possibility its future development. Moreover, we will read a classic paper from Andrew Feenberg to examine the democratic power of technology *(Feenberg 1992)*. By linking this paper with CyberGIS, we would discuss the intertwined democratic and autocratic power of CyberGIS and others alike.

### Week 5: Bot

We will spend two weeks on the topic of bot. Bot is an human-made artifact that automates programmed functions. It has been frequently used to implement repetitive work in order to emancipate human labors. GIScholars have also used bots to collect geospatial services, retrieve social media feeds, and conduct other replaceable tasks. Since data collection is an important step for any (digital) humanities studies, we plan to spend the entire Week 3 to focus on the practical exercise in order to help each student to design a web crawler -- a typical bot that can harvest online data. We expect this web crawler can help each student to advance progress of their own research. In this week, each student is encouraged to read Wenwen Li and her co-authors' paper to see how to build a web map crawler, and how it can be used to collect geospatial data for polar research *(Li et al 2016)*. Next, in week 4, we will convene to discuss the code of ethics related to web crawling *(Thelwall et al 2006)*. This discussion may shed light on the use of bots for any (digital) humanities studies. Moreover, each student will also read another piece of classic paper on the politics of Artifacts *(Winner 1986)*. This paper will initiate the group discussion on the political and social implications of bots.

### Week 6: Geospatial Data

In this week, we will focus on geospatial data. Similar to other types of data, it comprises of 0s and 1s. However, it is special because of the way of data storage and processing. To better understand why "spatial data is special", each student, in this week's practical exercise, is expected to store the crawled data in the previous week to a file-based geospatial database "spatialite." Through this exercise, a lucid understanding about the structure, storage, and management of geospatial data will be built. Moreover, we also offer three papers on the geospatial data uncertainties. Each of these papers adopts a different epistemology to examine the uncertainty issue (*MacEachren et al 2005; Kwan 2012; Zhang et al 2020)*.

### Week 7: GeoVisualization

GeoVisualization refers the visual representation and the representation strategies that illustrating geographical phenomenon using geospatial data. Through this week, we intend to present the development of geovisualization since the new millennium. It is recommended to read the paper from *MacEachren and his co-authors (2001)* that is a throughout literature review envisioning the topics in geovisualization to be explored. Knowles and her co-authors' paper represents a humanistic alternative to the conventional geovisualization *(2015)*, and emphasized the possible to visualize geographical phenomenon onto a non-euclidean space. Moreover, Roth's paper shared us an effective high-level guidance on how to craft a geo-narrative *(2020)*. In this week's practical exercise, each student is expected to create a online storymap.

### Week 8: GeoAI

GeoAI, namely Geospatial Artificial Intelligence, indicates the use and/or the rewire of Artificial Intelligence for geospatial analyses. In this week, we present a literature review on GeoAI and its multiple applicable areas *(Janowicz 2019)*. A promising area is place recognition, and a paper from *Bolei Zhou is offered (2017)*. Place, similar to space is an essential concept in geography. Moreover, another paper on deepfake geography is offer to share a more controversial use of GeoAI *(Zhao et al 2021)*.

### Week 9: Virtual Reality

<!-- **`The meeting is cancelled due to University Holiday. You are still required to read the paper and submit the weekly think pieces.`** -->

Virtual Reality (VR) is a computer-generated environment with scenes and objects that appear to be real, making the user feel they are immersed in their surroundings. This environment is perceived through a device known as a Virtual Reality headset. In this week, we will focus on the idea of GIS embodiment. To begin with, we will review a paper that introduce the concept of postphenomenology and its relevance to geography *(Lea 2020)*. This paper will help us to revisit the Humanistic GIS framework, especially how VR as a embodiment GIS. Next, we will read another paper to examine how VR can evoke different senses of embodiment *(Kiteni et al 2012)*. These senses also relates to the sense of space and place, and this paper helps us to better envision the geographies that will be produced by VR. In the end, we will review another paper to review how VR is considered as sexist *(Munafo et al 2017)*. By this paper, we encourage students to reflect upon the design and development of any technology, especially how we can avoid the examined technology could be more equitable for minority groups.

### Week 10: Summary, Presentation, and Writing Project

Each student presents the writing project during the last class meeting (05/25). And the writing project is due by 06/7 5:00pm.


## :calendar: Weekly Schedule


## Course Objectives

- 🧭 **Critical GIS Foundations:** Develop a foundational understanding of Critical GIS, including its critiques and applications.

- 🛰️ **GIS, Power, and Society:** Examine the relationship between GIS, power, and society, engaging with debates on spatial data politics, surveillance, and digital inequalities.

- 🛠️ **Hands-on GeoAI and Mapping:** Gain hands-on experience with GeoAI, participatory mapping, and geovisualization techniques.

- ⚖️ **Mixed-Methods Integration:** Apply mixed-methods research, integrating quantitative GIS analysis with qualitative spatial narratives.


## :bell: Course Requirement

**:computer:  Computational skill:** This course welcomes students who some computational experience, or have programmed in a python or javascript IDE (Integrated Development Environment). Students should at least hear of GIS, GitHub, Leaflet, web crawler, or Raspberry Pi before considering this seminar, and most importantly, be self-motivated to solve a research question with the listed computational skills.

**:scroll: Statement of intent:** Please prepare a short statement of intent describing your project on or before the end of **Week 1.** Please feel free to plan your writing project to help advance progress in your own work – qualifying exam essay, draft of journal article, side project, etc. I am happy to meet with you to talk more about your writing project.

**:rocket: GitHub:** This course material will be hosted on GitHub instead of UW Canvas. On this dedicated GitHub repository for this course, you can find most of the course material, participate in group discussions by submitting GitHub issues, and creating new GitHub repositories to turn in practical exercise deliverables. By the end of this quarter, you will be more proficient in operating a cloud-based coding environment and able to host your work online as a way to gain public and peer attentions.

**:teacher: Seminar leadership:** You will take at least two turns facilitating our seminar exercise and discussion with a few of your classmates. You will work with one or more others (depending on the enrollment) on this, so you are not responsible for the entire session yourself. Please work together to prepare some activities and guiding questions that will inspire and structure our discussion of the material. The instructor is happy to help you to prepare the practical exercise walk-through before the meeting class.

**:trophy: Practical exercise:** You need to get familiar with the practical exercise instruction before the class meeting in order to better reflect upon the theoretical concepts. We will walk through each practical exercise in class, and you will submit the deliverables to GitHub several days before the class meeting (you will have two weeks for your Week 3&4’s exercise deliverable). **As a requirement, you need to submit two lab deliverables. One is Lab 1, and the other is a lab of your interest.**

**:woman_technologist: Participation in seminar discussion:** Complete all assigned readings and get familiar with the practical exercise instructions before class meetings, and participating in critical discussions of those readings.

**:woman_scientist: Thinkpiece:** Your weekly think pieces should be at least 350 words in length and should engage critically with **3 or more of the week’s readings**. There is no right or wrong way to write a think piece and you should feel free to experiment, but ensure that you are citing your sources and that your piece is clear and free of any typos. Below are some additional suggestions/guiding thoughts to help shape your piece.

- Though your think piece doesn’t need to follow a formal essay structure, organization, content, and clarity is still important.
- Don’t merely summarize. Develop your own thoughts and reflections in connection to the readings, the lab assignments and the weekly lecture.
- Lead your reader somewhere beyond the simple observation; in other words, make a point or several points and examine them in depth.
- Use examples and quotations from the assigned text to support what you say. Effective quotations make the piece stronger and more convincing.
- Use the practical exercise to express more than how you “feel” about the text or problem. Whether you liked the text or not is relevant but should not be the central focus of your think piece.
- Make connections between the assigned text and the course content and above all, explore your own ideas and thoughts about the assigned text; after all, that is the point of the assignment.

Please craft your think piece to the [**GitHub issues page**](https://github.com/jakobzhao/geog595/issues) two days before the meeting – so your colleagues leading discussion can draw on your ideas in planning activities for our class session.

**:open_book: Writing project:** During the quarter, you will complete a larger writing project that engages with the seminar material and course themes, along with additional readings that you bring into conversation with the assigned course readings. You are aiming for 15-20 pages coalescing around ideas and readings from this quarter – you can take up and extend one of the themes from our weekly structure or develop a new one relevant to your own work and thinking. Writing projects is due no later than the end of **Week 10**.

## :heavy_check_mark: Grading

Based on the above requirements - **40%** seminar participation, think pieces, and discussion leadership, **20%** practical exercise, **40%** writing project.

## :notebook_with_decorative_cover: Equity & Inclusivity

Our very highest priorities include creating a brave and supportive class environment where each of us contributes, we can ask big questions, we give and receive critiques in a supportive way, we notice and engage the ways that we are differently situated within past and present relationship of power, privilege and oppression. I invite you to think hard about how race, gender identity, religion, age, citizenship status, first language, ability, sexuality, class, and other axes are at work in our interactions, and what this might mean in terms of when to speak up, when to step back, how to listen, and much more. Each of you is a welcome and invaluable part of our collective whole.
