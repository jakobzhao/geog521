### üìò *Critical GIS Foundational Concepts ‚Äì A Cheatsheet*

- **Space Cadets**  
  A label for a cohort of geographers in the mid-20th century‚Äîmostly students of William Garrison at the University of Washington‚Äîwho sought to revolutionize geography through mathematical modeling, spatial analysis, and early computer technology. Their mission was to transform geography into a spatial science grounded in positivist logic. This group laid much of the technical groundwork for GIS.  
  Key figures include:
  
  - **Waldo Tobler** ‚Äì Known for formulating the *First Law of Geography* (‚ÄúEverything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things‚Äù), he pioneered spatial modeling and computer cartography.
  - **Brian Berry** ‚Äì A leader in quantitative urban geography and regional science, he introduced advanced statistical methods to study urban hierarchies, migration, and spatial interaction.
  - **Richard Morrill** ‚Äì Contributed to spatial analysis in political geography, especially in the study of redistricting, voting patterns, and urban policy using GIS techniques.
  - **William Bunge** ‚Äì Initially a rising star in spatial analysis, Bunge later rejected the apolitical tone of spatial science and turned to radical geography. His *Detroit Geographical Expedition and Institute (DGEI)* used maps as tools for social justice.

- **Quantitative Revolution**  
  A transformative movement in geography during the 1950s‚Äì1970s that aimed to bring scientific rigor to the discipline. It prioritized spatial modeling, empirical validation, and statistical methods, reshaping geography into a predictive, analytical field. While it advanced technical sophistication, it also marginalized qualitative and experiential perspectives, setting the stage for later reactions from critical and humanistic geographers.

- **1995 Friday Harbor Meeting**  
  A landmark interdisciplinary gathering at the University of Washington‚Äôs Friday Harbor Laboratories, organized by the National Center for Geographic Information and Analysis (NCGIA). Key organizers and relevant scholars included **Tom Poiker**, **Michael Goodchild**, **John Pickles**, and **Nick Chrisman**. The meeting fostered dialogue‚Äîand tension‚Äîbetween GIScientists and critical human geographers. It catalyzed the emergence of *Critical GIS* by questioning who GIS serves, what forms of knowledge it encodes, and how power circulates through spatial technologies.

- **Humanistic Geography**  
  A counter-movement to the Quantitative Revolution that arose in the 1970s. Humanistic geographers focus on lived experience, perception, emotion, and the symbolic meanings of place.  **Yi-Fu Tuan** is widely considered the founder of Humanistic Geography. His work explored how people emotionally and spiritually relate to place (*Topophilia*, *Space and Place*).  
  The movement's core aim is to bring **meaning, ethics, and subjectivity** back into geographic inquiry. It later inspired emotional geography, narrative cartography, and participatory GIS approaches.

- **NCGIA (National Center for Geographic Information and Analysis)**  
  The National Center for Geographic Information and Analysis was founded in 1988 as a collaborative research initiative between UC Santa Barbara, SUNY Buffalo, and the University of Maine, funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation. It played a pivotal role in legitimizing GIScience as an academic field and was instrumental in shaping early GIS research agendas. NCGIA provided intellectual infrastructure through its ‚Äúresearch initiatives,‚Äù interdisciplinary workshops, and white papers. Importantly, it also served as the **institutional host of the 1995 Friday Harbor meeting**, marking the birth of Critical GIS as a named field.

- **Initiative 19 (I-19): "The Social Implications of How People, Space, and Environment Are Represented in GIS"**  
  I-19 was one of the most philosophically and politically charged of the NCGIA research initiatives. Launched in the early 1990s, it brought together scholars from GIScience and critical human geography to confront the social, political, and epistemological assumptions behind spatial representation in GIS. Key figures involved included **Michael Goodchild**, **Eric Sheppard**, **John Pickles**, and **Helen Couclelis**.  
  The discussions from I-19 culminated in the **1993 Friday Harbor meeting**, where many foundational questions of Critical GIS were first collectively addressed, such as: Whose knowledge counts in GIS? How do technologies encode power? Can GIS represent non-Western, indigenous, or feminist spatialities?
